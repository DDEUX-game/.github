For Chainlink Hackathon Judges:
1. Check the Contracts in the Contracts repo.  We use these to enable a revenue flow (and cost offset for our backend wallet will need to initiate transactions to RankedMatches (for security). For now, we just have a Price Feed secured purchasable Ranked Match Access key and the RankedMatches game state tracker.

2. Our mobile-first front-end is on the Frontend repo. This is where most of the code lives.  Tippi started the frontend a bit before the hackathon, but the new cards, sockets and web3 security features (such as token gating with Thirdweb Auth) all happened during the hackathon.
